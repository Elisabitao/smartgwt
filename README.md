For a quick conceptual overview of Smart GWT, [read this article](http://www.jroller.com/sjivan/entry/smartgwt_1_0_released).

Smart GWT is based on the powerful and mature [SmartClient](http://www.smartclient.com/) library. In addition to Smart GWT LGPL, [Pro & Enterprise](http://www.smartclient.com/product) editions of Smart GWT are available with additional features & tools, as well as [commercial support](http://www.smartclient.com/services/index.jsp).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smart GWT is compatible with GWT 1.6.4, GWT 1.7.x and GWT 2.x

**Migration from Google Code**

SmartGWT has been migrated from [Google Code](https://code.google.com/p/smartgwt/) as Google will be switching projects to "read only" on 8/24/2015 and shutting down the service on 1/25/2016.  If you notice something that doesn't seem to have been migrated properly, let us know.  Note that while GitHub supports SVN access to this project, the revision numbers here are different than those in Google Code due to GitHub's architecture - this cannot be avoided.
